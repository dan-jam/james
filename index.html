	<h1>Autobiography</h1>
	<h2>I am <span>Daniel James P. Abobo</span></h2>
	<p>a freshman at Bukidnon State University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. I live in Purok 2 Casisang, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. Although my first name is Daniel, I prefer to be called by my second name, James. This name feels familiar and comfortable to me, as it is what my parents have always called me.</p>
	<p>I have a particular fondness for the color blue. Unlike the common association of blue with sadness, I find blue to be a color that exudes joy and tranquility. When I am alone, I often listen to music as a source of comfort and inspiration. It helps me to relax and recharge.</p>
	<p>I am still on a journey of self-discovery, eager to uncover the depths of my personality. I am open to growth and learning, excited to embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
