		<h4>HTML Activity</h4>
		<p>Through this activity, I discovered how websites are created, their structures, and their designs. I learned that each part of a website has specific syntax that determines how it appears on your device's screen. It is fascinating to know that behind every detail, even the smallest one you see on a website, there is a lot of code involved.</p>

		<p>In this activity, we created a wireframe for our website. When I first started making my wireframe, I was unsure about the layout and design because I had never created a website before. But now, I have finally completed my first website, and I am so happy that I was able to create it. Although this website is not exactly the same as the wireframe I made, it helped me visualize the process of building my website.</p>

		<h4>Technology Trends Activity</h4>
		<p>We were put into groups for this activity. My group and I looked into how Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) are connected. We found out that these technologies are changing many industries, like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Cloud computing helps businesses by giving them data-driven information, while AI can do tasks automatically and personalize things. IoT links devices together, making smart homes and efficient factories possible.</p>
