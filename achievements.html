	<h4>My JHS Moving Up</h4>
	<p>This photo was taken back when I was about to finish my junior high school. I was so proud of myself because I never thought I would be an honor student. I used to feel lost in class, struggling to understand our lessons while others always get it right away. But I did not give up, I pushed myself to catch up and I made it. This achievement means a lot to me.</p>

	<h4>My SHS Graduation</h4>
	<p>This photo was taken during my pictorial for our senior high school graduation. I often smile with my lips closed, as I do not like showing off my teeth in photos. However, on this special day, I could not contain my happiness. All the late nights studying, the stressful exams, and the countless hours of hard work had finally paid off. I was so proud to graduate as one of the top students in our class.</p>

	<h4>My Family</h4>
	<p>This is a photo of my family. Originally, there are six of us, but my three older siblings were not present when this photo was taken. I included my family here because, without them, I would not have come this far in life. They are my source of inspiration and support. I am deeply grateful to have them, especially my parents. They always do everything for us siblings. Saying thank you is not enough to express how proud and grateful I am for them. </p>

	<h4>My Circle of Friends</h4>
	<p>This is a group photo of my friends from our senior high school days. Because of them, my high school journey was filled with fun and unforgettable memories. We always helped each other, both academically and emotionally. Although we now have different lives in college, we still hang out and keep in touch whenever we have time. Having them as my friends is something to be proud of.</p>
